1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans:True ansd False
    How do you write
    a=True
    c=False
    print('a:',a)
    print('c:',c)



2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

Ans:
 	AND
	OR
	NOT

3.Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth table(ie.every possible combination of 
  Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate)

Ans:    print(1 and 1, 1 and 0, 0 and 1, 0 and 0)
	print(1 or 1, 1 or 0, 0 or 1, 0 or 0)
	print(not 1, not 0) 

4.What are  the values of the following expression?
  (5>4) and (3==5)  ==>False
   not(5>4)        ===>False
   (5>4) or (3==5)   ===>True
   not((5>4) or(3==5))===>False
   (True and True)and(True== False)===>False
   (not False)or( not True) ==>True



5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans:
1. ==  : is equal to
2. !=  : is not equal to
3. \>   : is greater than
4. \>=  : is greater than or equal to
5. <   : is less than
6. <=  : is less than or equal to
    	


6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.


 ' = '  : single equals to sign is used for the assignment operation.
 ' == ' : double equals to sign is used for the equal to condition check.

 When we want to assign something (eg. a = 10) we use the assignment operator.
 whereas when we want to check some condition (eg. 10 == 100) we use the equal to
 condition check operator. 



7. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0 <br>
if spam == 10: 
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:<br>
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Ans :
	spam=0
	if samp==0 #block 1
	print("eggs)
	if spam>5:
	   print('bacon')#block 2
 	else:		#block 3
            print('ham')
	print("spam")
	print("spam")
              


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam,
 and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
spam=1
if spam==1:
   print("Hello")
elif spam==2:
   print("Howdy")
else:
   print("Greetings!")



9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

1. Press Ctrl + C on the command line.
2. Restart the kernal

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans:
    - Break:    It is used to break the loop and exit from the loop
    - continue: It is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with 
                 the next iteration.


11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and 
    range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans : No Difference


12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.


Ans: By using for loop:

     for i in range(1,11):
	print(i)

     By using while loop:

     i=1	
     while i<=10:
	print(i)
        i+=1


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?

Ans:   import spam
       spam.bacon()
